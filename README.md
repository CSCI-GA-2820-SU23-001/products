This is the repository for the Products Service project for the NYU DevOps Summer 2023 class.

## Overview

This project template contains starter code for your class project. The `/service` folder contains your `models.py` file for your model and a `routes.py` file for your service. The `/tests` folder has test case starter code for testing the model and the service separately. All you need to do is add your functionality. You can use the [lab-flask-tdd](https://github.com/nyu-devops/lab-flask-tdd) for code examples to copy from.

## Automatic Setup

The best way to use this repo is to start your own repo using it as a git template. To do this just press the green **Use this template** button in GitHub and this will become the source for your repository.

## Manual Setup

You can also clone this repository and then copy and paste the starter code into your project repo folder on your local computer. Be careful not to copy over your own `README.md` file so be selective in what you copy.

There are 4 hidden files that you will need to copy manually if you use the Mac Finder or Windows Explorer to copy files from this folder into your repo folder.

These should be copied using a bash shell as follows:

```bash
    cp .gitignore  ../<your_repo_folder>/
    cp .flaskenv ../<your_repo_folder>/
    cp .gitattributes ../<your_repo_folder>/
```
